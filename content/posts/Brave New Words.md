This book is an invitation to incorporate artificial intelligence into students' lives. It is not a technical book but rather the account of a teacher interested in advancing education with this cutting-edge technology.

## Actions

1. Educating students on how to use Artificial Intelligence correctly, say, as a tutor, can greatly enhance their learning experience.
2. Besides answering tricky questions, generative AI modes can be used to explain reasoning, generate new questions, or even take on personas with human-like traits. And it wouldn't stop there; what if they were used to:
    1. Assist the teacher with lesson plans
    2. Debate with students
    3. Inspire students with new ideas
    4. Mitigate teacher burnout
    5. Monitor classroom progress

   AIs can help students by drafting essays, making them better writers, and providing immediate feedback.
   
3. Create prompts so that the model writes with you, not for you.
    1. “You will be my Socratic tutor. I will be your student; I don’t want answers.”
4. Teach students to refine the responses they receive from the model by cross-checking information with external, reliable sources.
5. Use AI as a tool to monitor the mental health of your students.
6. Determine the extent to which the model can assist the student, e.g.:
    1. Correcting grammar
    2. Suggesting synonyms

   The teacher could then inquire about how much the student used to check for plagiarism/cheating.

## Notes

When Bill Gates saw GPT-3, he said he wouldn't be surprised until it could pass a basic biology exam. Months later, OpenAI introduced GPT-4, and its demo showed its success in the exam.
