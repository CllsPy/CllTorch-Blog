# Today I Learned

### Day 01: 07 July 2024

Generative AI
- LLMs are trained on a large amount of data sourced from across the internet, which means there is a high possibility of containing bias or inappropriate content.

Soft Engineering
- I learned that a software engineer must possess two principles: self-learning and problem-solving.
- A good software engineer is capable of delivering a secure and functional product, and this can be achieved through Unit Test.

- 00:14  Define objectives clearly in step one and prioritize them based on their importance.
- 00:28  Step two involves acquiring and preparing your data for analysis.
- 00:53  Explore your data thoroughly in step four to gain insights.
- 01:10  Train your models effectively in step six, ensuring they perform well on training data.
- 01:24 ️ Tune and debug your models using separate validation data in step seven.
- 01:36 ️ Validate your model's performance with fresh data in step eight.
- 01:49  Test your model's readiness for production in step nine.
- 02:04  Document your decision-making process and expected performance in new data.
- 02:16  Prepare your model for production with automated retraining in step ten.
- 02:30  Make launch decisions cautiously in step eleven and implement a policy layer.
- 02:44  Continuously monitor and maintain your model to address technical debt in step twelve.
