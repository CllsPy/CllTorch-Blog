- LLMs are trained on a large amount of data sourced from across the internet, which means there is a high possibility of containing bias or inappropriate content.

Soft Engineering
- I learned that a software engineer must possess two principles: self-learning and problem-solving.
- A good software engineer is capable of delivering a secure and functional product, and this can be achieved through Unit Test.
