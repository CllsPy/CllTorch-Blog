## Day 6: July 31, 2024

- I learned about the concept of "maximum margin" in machine learning models.
- I understood that larger margins help reduce generalization error, while smaller margins increase the risk of overfitting or underfitting.
- I became familiar with the concept of "slack variables," introduced by W. Vapnik in 1995, which make SVM models more flexible when data is not linearly separable.
- I learned that these variables are represented by the parameter \( C \), which controls error tolerance and the trade-off between bias and variance.
- I realized that adjusting the value of \( C \) is crucial for ensuring the model generalizes well to new data, avoiding overfitting and underfitting.

## Day 8: Aug 3, 2024

- Today I learned about decision tree learning.
- Tree-based models are a good choice when interpretability is crucial.
- Data is classified based on the questions the model asks.
- The process starts at the top of the tree, selecting the feature with the highest Information Gain (IG).
- This process is repeated until the branches are pure, meaning a class has been chosen.
- In practice, this process can easily lead to overfitting.
- The goal is to choose the feature that provides the highest possible gain in information.
- To achieve this, an objective function is defined and optimized using the Decision Tree algorithm.
- Mathematically, Information Gain is the difference between the impurity of the parent node and the sum of the impurities of the child nodes.
- The lower the impurity of the children, the higher the gain.
- Computationally, it can be impractical, so sklearn uses the binary decision tree algorithm.
- The impurity measures used by binary decision trees include: Gini impurity (IG), Entropy (IH), and Classification Error (IE).

## Day 9: Aug 4, 2024

- Random Forest is a technique that combines multiple decision trees.
- This model is considered an **ensemble** of decision trees.
- Random Forest averages the decision trees to generate a consistent result.
- The method helps to avoid overfitting.
- The technique consists of four main steps:
  1. Create a test set.
  2. Branch a decision tree for each test set and split the features at each node with the highest gain, based on the chosen metric.
  3. Repeat steps 1 and 2.
  4. Aggregate the results and choose the winning class by majority vote.

## Day 10: Aug 6, 2024

- I learned that Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to generate more consistent results and avoid overfitting.
- I learned that the Random Forest process involves creating test sets, building a decision tree for each test set, repeating these steps, and finally aggregating the results through majority voting.
- I learned that reducing the sample size increases diversity and reduces the chances of overfitting, although it may negatively impact overall performance.
- I learned that K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a lazy-learning algorithm that memorizes training data instead of optimizing a function.
- I learned that KNN is a non-parametric and instance-based algorithm, which adapts easily to new data but requires more resources as the amount of data increases.
- I learned that KNN classifies data by identifying the nearest elements and choosing the class based on majority voting.

## Day 11: Aug 7, 2024

- In the real world, data can be presented in different ways, generally irregular, missing values ​​are one of the manifestations, they can occur for several reasons; forgetfulness, non-existence of information; typing errors. There are techniques to deal with the absence of this data, such as deleting or replacing the data.
- We can use `isnull().sum()` to verify all null values on a dataframe
- To remove null data from our dataframe we can you the method .drop(), the method has some parameters i.e 'all' that removes only rows where all values are null.
