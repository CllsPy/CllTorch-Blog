# Today I Learned (TIL)

## Generative AI

- LLMs are trained on a large amount of data sourced from across the internet, which means there is a high possibility of containing bias or inappropriate content.

## Soft Engineering

- I learned that a software engineer must possess two principles: self-learning and problem-solving.
- A good software engineer is capable of delivering a secure and functional product, and this can be achieved through Unit Test.
- How to make a Unit Test using Python
- I learned what is TDD (Test-Drive Development): A method to write software where first you write and after write code.
- DRY
  - DRY means that your code should have less repetition as possible.
  - Less repetition means less bugs

## Golang

- How create a `function`
- How to call a  `function`
- How use `arrays` and operate  them

## Python

- Unit Test
  - `python -m unittest test_module.py`
  - assertEqual
  - assertRaise
