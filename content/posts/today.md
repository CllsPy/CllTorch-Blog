# üåü **Today I Learned (TIL)**

## Day 1: July 19, 2024

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** are trained on vast amounts of data sourced from the internet, which means there is a high possibility of containing bias or inappropriate content.
- I learned that a software engineer must possess two principles: **self-learning** and **problem-solving**.
- A good software engineer is capable of delivering a **secure** and **functional** product, achievable through **Unit Testing**.
- How to make a Unit Test using Python:
  - üêç **Unit Testing in Python**
    - Use `python -m unittest test_module.py`
    - Common assertions: `assertEqual`, `assertRaises`
- I learned about **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: A method to write software where you first write the tests, then write the code.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
  - Your code should have as little repetition as possible.
  - Less repetition means fewer bugs.
- How to create a **function**.
- How to call a **function**.
- How to use **arrays** and operate them.
