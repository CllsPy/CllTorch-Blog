# üåü **Today I Learned (TIL)**

## Day 1: July 19, 2024

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** are trained on vast amounts of data sourced from the internet, which means there is a high possibility of containing bias or inappropriate content.
- I learned that a software engineer must possess two principles: **self-learning** and **problem-solving**.
- A good software engineer is capable of delivering a **secure** and **functional** product, achievable through **Unit Testing**.
- How to make a Unit Test using Python:
  - üêç **Unit Testing in Python**
    - Use `python -m unittest test_module.py`
    - Common assertions: `assertEqual`, `assertRaises`
- I learned about **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: A method to write software where you first write the tests, then write the code.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
  - Your code should have as little repetition as possible.
  - Less repetition means fewer bugs.
- How to create a **function**.
- How to call a **function**.
- How to use **arrays** and operate them.
- **Unit Testing**
  - Use `python -m unittest test_module.py`
  - Common assertions: `assertEqual`, `assertRaises`.

## Day 2: July 20, 2024

- Learned how to authenticate HuggingFace using the login screen in Google Colab.
- Discovered the model [HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-1.7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-1.7B-Instruct?text=write+a+poem).
- Explored the functionality of Prompt Template in LangChain.
- Understood the importance of standardizing prompts.
- Learned how to create an API and use it in Colab.
- Learned how the Prompt Template in LangChain works.
- Understood why it is important to standardize the prompt.
- Learned how to create an API and use it in Colab.
