## 🌟 **Today I Learned (TIL)**

---

### 🤖 **Generative AI**

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** are trained on vast amounts of data sourced from the internet, which means there is a high possibility of containing bias or inappropriate content.

---

### 💻 **Software Engineering**

- I learned that a software engineer must possess two principles: **self-learning** and **problem-solving**.
- A good software engineer is capable of delivering a **secure** and **functional** product, achievable through **Unit Testing**.
- How to make a Unit Test using Python:
  - 🐍 **Unit Testing in Python**
    - Use `python -m unittest test_module.py`
    - Common assertions: `assertEqual`, `assertRaise`
- I learned about **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: A method to write software where you first write the tests, then write the code.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
  - Your code should have as little repetition as possible.
  - Less repetition means fewer bugs.

- How to create a **function**.
- How to call a **function**.
